          <p class="header">Overview</p>
          <p class="text">Twitch (in collaboration with Amazon) offers a subscription service titled “Prime” for users who wish to enhance both their streaming and gaming experiences. The service currently provides its members with various benefits as is, key features being free exclusive content for a large library of games, free games, and a free monthly subscription to any streamer. However, these features are only accessible through their website, keeping the experience from mobile users. With this in mind, I explored ways to integrate the Prime service to Twitch’s mobile app and conceptualized a new feature that would further incentivize more Prime subscriptions going forward.</p>

          <p class="text">The absence of Prime’s features on mobile creates a gap between users who prefer the mobile app versus those who use Twitch’s website. How can the mobile experience be updated to match its web counterpart?</p>

              <p class="text">Ads are necessary, but frankly, most users don’t care to be interrupted by them. One pain point that I wanted to address was how intrusive ads are on Twitch compared to one of its biggest competitors in YouTube. Based on the secondary statistics below, I concluded that the addition of a “skip ad” feature similar to YouTube’s would be one benefit that would reinforce the need for Prime amongst current Twitch users.</p>

            Being that this was my first ever UX project I am proud of the output I was able to create independently. However, even with what I’ve produced here, I do understand there is room for me to grow from this. One key idea I learned during this project specifically was the value of iteration. Referring back to the problem and pain points (constantly) helped guide me to creating and iterating solutions with intention rather than impulse.
          <br>
          <br>
            One thing I’d like to expand upon is gathering primary research and feedback from the user. My insights and design decisions were derived from secondary research throughout this project. With direct feedback from target users through processes such as usability testing, I would be able to properly gauge the success (or failure) of the designs/ prototypes developed.
